  <p><em>the legends</em></p>
  <p>The date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is disputed.
   The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument, a simple flute, 
   dates back as far as 67,000 years. Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago. 
  . Many early musical instruments were made from animal skins, bone, wood, 
   and other non-durable materials..</p>

        <p>The earliest stringed instruments known to archaeologists are bowl harps and tanburs</p>
        <p>Since prehistory people have made bowl harps using tortoise shells and calabashes as resonators, with a bent stick for a neck and one or more gut or silk strings. The world's museums contain many such "harps" from the ancient Sumerian, Babylonian, and Egyptian civilisations.</p>
        <p>Around 2500 - 2000 CE more advanced harps, such as the opulently carved 11-stringed instrument with gold decoration found in Queen Shub-Ad's tomb, started to appear</p>

        <p>At 3500 years old, this is the ultimate vintage guitar! It belonged to the Egyptian singer Har-Mose. He was buried with his tanbur close to the tomb of his employer,</p>
        <p>Sen-Mut, architect to Queen Hatshepsut, who was crowned in 1503 BCE. Sen-Mut (who, it is suspected, was far more than just chief minister and architect to the queen) built Hatshepsuts beautiful mortuary temple, which stands on the banks of the Nile to this day. </p>
        <p>Har-Moses instrument had three strings and a plectrum suspended from the neck by a cord. The soundbox was made of beautifully polished cedarwood and had a rawhide "soundboard". It can be seen today at the Archaeological Museum in Cairo</p>

        <p>The Moors brought the oud to Spain. The tanbur had taken another line of development in the Arabian countries, changing in its proportions and remaining fretless</p>
        <p>The Europeans added frets to the oud and called it a "lute" - this derives from the Arabic "Al'ud" (literally "the wood"), via the Spanish name "laud".</p>
        <p>A lute or oud is defined as a "short-necked instrument with many strings, a large pear-shaped body with highly vaulted back, and an elaborate, sharply angled peghead".</p>
